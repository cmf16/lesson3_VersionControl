            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems are one main repository for all the project files. Multiple people are able to take files, revise them, and then put them back. The system notes revision history, when it was changed, who changed it, etc. The benefits of Version Control Systems are that the files cannot be overwritten, people can work at the same time on the same file, and you can revert back to an older version of the file. Reverting back to an older version of the file is useful because in the case that the code is messed up at some point. This topic is interesting to me because I will be using them in this class to work on projects. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two different types of repositories. One type of repository is called a remote repository. This type of repository is on a remote server shared with multiple people working on the project. An example of a remote repository could be GitHub. GitHub is used to share stored projects with other people. The other type of repository is called a local repository. Local repositories are on a local machine of individual users. An example of a local repository is Cloud9. Local repositories are made either by creating a new repository or by cloning an existing remote repository onto a local machine. This topic is interesting to me because I will be using GitHub and Cloud9 to complete this assignment. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Version Control System (VCS) that makes the process of managing and backing up files much easier. It is important to know Git is free and open source. Every user has copies of the repository data stored on their local machine. This process is quick and prevents files from being overwritten in the repository. There are many commands used for Git in order to get the files to the remote repository. For example, creating a local repository requires the command “git init”. To get files from the local repository to the remote repository, the command “push” is used. Git is interesting to me because I learned how to use some of the commands while completing this assignment. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Repository Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When working in Git, files are considered to be either tracked files or untracked files. A tracked file is one that was in the last snapshot or one that Git currently knows about. An untracked file is everything else that includes files in the work area that have yet to be committed. I find this interesting because Git knows when files are modified. Having files be continuously updated back to the Git repository will be helpful in this course. In the future, I think it will be helpful to have background in this topic to successfully share files for group assignments. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Checking Status of Files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The main command used to check the status of a file is the git status command. By typing the git status command in the terminal will allow you to see whether or not a file is tracked. The git add command can be used to being tracking a new file. These commands will be useful for the web application development class because it will help to find out whether a file is tracked or not. I find these commands to be interesting because they seem like they will be helpful when I am unsure whether or not my files are tracked to the Git repository. </p>
